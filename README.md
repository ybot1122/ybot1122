My name is Toby. I am web developer expanding into native mobile app development.

Currently:
- Learning Swift (Udemy)
- Learning Flutter (Udemy)
- Building websites for friends
- Building out my own "TobyUI" shared component and SDK library

Hoping to:
- Build backends with Rust
- Launch an app into the app stores
- Build a mini deployment pipeline to AWS EC2 (i.e. migrate off of Vercel)
