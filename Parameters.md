It is well engrained that failure is an essential, and sometimes even welcome, stepping stone for our lives. Increasingly, I discover many people have begun to engineer their failures so as to check it off their list of milestones for growth. This type of thinking stems from either pride or fear.

- Pride: I know the lessons I'm suposed to learn, so I'm just setting up this failure so I can look like I'm learning it.
- Fear: I don't want failure to be too big or to come at an inconvenient moment, so I will setup a controlled failure.

The way to remedy this approach is to invert the script. Instead of using pride and fear to prepare for failure, you need to develop humility and confidence.

- Humility: The world is complex enough such that failure is inevitable.
- Confidence: Have the foundation, experience, and perspective, that will allow you to navigate failure.

Unfortunately, most people are challenged by the call to humility and confidence because it forces us to confront some harsh realities:

- We can't control everything, and
- there is no substitute for hard work.

If you're not sure whether or not you're truly learning from failure, consider this statement: I could have prevented Failure Y if I had been able to control Parameter X. Does this statement ring true to you?
