In our careers, we often reach a level which appears to be our limit. This is a difficult moment. It is a moment when doing what we were doing before doesn't work anymore.

When upwards growth has stalled, almost all people commit to the following strategy: Try the same thing, but harder.

Most people don't even consider growing downwards as an option.

Stop investing energy towards upward growth. Shift it to growing roots instead.

- Nurture relationships, new and old, in and outside the workplace.
- Reconcile with colleagues, the friendly and the adversarial ones.
- Become a student again, and learn from anyone who will bless you with their teaching.
- Spend more time with the people you think have nothing to offer you.
- Relearn the things you thought you had mastered.

If you truly invest into growing downwards, you will learn more about who you are. You will discover different ways of thinking, new perspectives, and what kinds of things are important to other people.

Don't dismiss this as a new age buddha zen inner peace yoga warrior memo.

This is the hard work it takes to become a leader.

Most will give up and go back to trying the same thing they did before, but harder.
